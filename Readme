Superuser  credentials : Username:admin , password: 123
I have not create the frontend due to lack of time , but all major api has been made and tested in postman
Postman link : https://gold-station-436287.postman.co/workspace/My-Workspace~84e3c1b4-98de-46d2-8f82-a44248eceaca/collection/19371747-3c3d1015-b128-4562-b54e-43a6a848352d?action=share&creator=19371747
API that i have created are : 
. register (to register of user)
. login (login of user , simple jwt is used for authentication)
. create_document (making of the notes)
. delete_document (deleting notes)
. doc_by_title (searching notes according to it's title)
. show_all_docs (show all the notes available)
. update_document (update the notes)

In login api during successful login a token will generate , keep in mind to paste that token in  Authorization-> Type-> Bearer Token to make other api run , as all other api are jwt authenticated(exept register)
I have tried to cover all major api that can be used in this project , still some api might be left behind
